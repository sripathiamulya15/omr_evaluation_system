# 📝 Automated OMR Evaluation System

A hackathon project for automated evaluation of OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) sheets using computer vision and machine learning.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated OMR Processing**: Upload images and get instant results
- **Multi-Version Support**: Handles different exam versions (Set A, Set B)
- **Subject-wise Scoring**: Automatic breakdown by subjects (Python, Data Analysis, MySQL, Power BI, Advanced Stats)
- **Error Detection**: Handles multiple answers, blank responses, and invalid marks
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Score distributions, performance metrics, and visualizations
- **Export Options**: CSV, Excel, and JSON export formats
- **Real-time Processing**: Process multiple sheets with progress tracking

## 📊 Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Plotly
- **Export**: XlsxWriter

## 🎯 Accuracy

- Target error rate: <0.5%
- Processing time: <30 seconds per sheet
- Supports 100 questions across 5 subjects

## 📱 Usage

1. Select the correct exam version (A or R)
2. Upload OMR sheet images (JPG, PNG)
3. View real-time processing results
4. Analyze individual and batch performance
5. Export results in multiple formats

## 🔧 Image Requirements

- Clear, well-lit images
